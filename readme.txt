Gives a simple mailto: link on top of a post for logged in admins, to email all commenters on a post, and adds an email link in the edit comments page, to easily email a commenter with a link to the post he commented on.

== Description ==
Sometimes you want an easy way to e-mail all the people who commented on a certain post. Up till now that took a bit of work, now it's as easy as installing this plugin, and clicking the link you'll get on the top of each post labeled "Mail the commenters on this post". You can also do the same from the edit comments page for single commenters.
