Adds a mail icon in the toolbar that allows emailing everyone who commented on a post.

== Description ==
Sometimes you want an easy way to e-mail all the people who commented on a certain post. Up till now that took a bit of work, now it's as easy as installing this plugin, and clicking the mail icon you'll get in the toolbar. You can also do the same from the edit comments page for single commenters.

Both of these functions will allow for far easier interaction with your commenters.
